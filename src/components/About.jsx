            I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect
            user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust
            engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and
            development, creating experiences that not only look great but are
            meticulously built for performance and usability.

            Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at Klaviyo, specializing
            in accessibility. I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI
            components that power Klaviyo's frontend, ensuring our platform
            meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an
            inclusive user experience.

            In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a
            variety of settings â€” from advertising agencies and large
            corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios.
            Additionally, I also released a comprehensive video course a few
            years ago, guiding learners through building a web app with the
            Spotify API.

            In my spare time, I'm usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my
            wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok
            seeds Korokseeds .
